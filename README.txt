This project provides a comprehensive MATLAB application integrated with a Python script for processing and analyzing battery formation data. The application allows users to select and process NDA files, perform digital signal processing to analyze battery cell formation efficiently, and visualize the results.

Project Overview
The Formation Checker 1.0 application is designed to assist in analyzing the formation data of battery cells. It includes the following key features:

Process Type Selection: Users can choose the type of formation process to be analyzed.
Battery Type Selection: Users can select specific battery types for tailored analysis.
File Selection: A Python script is used to select and convert NDA files for processing.
Analyze Button: Executes the main analysis function, providing insights into battery cell formation with detailed error checking and efficiency calculations.
Result Visualization: Displays detailed results and visualizations, including voltage and current plots, and error indications.

Features
Process Type Selection: Choose the process type for formation data analysis.
Battery Type Selection: Choose the battery type for specific analysis requirements.
File Selection: Use the Python script to select and process NDA files.
Analyze: Perform the main analysis function using digital signal processing techniques.
Result Visualization: View the results in the MATLAB app interface, including detailed plots and error reports.
